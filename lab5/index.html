	<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>

			<div id="info">
				<h2> <Challenges</h2>
					<p>Our challenge was to first test out declaring different data types
						by declaring them as variables. We needed to describe a vehicle using
						 strings, numbers and booleans. I chose to describe my mom’s Honda
						 Pilot that I drove throughout high school. I first practiced declaring
						  the variables of my old car in the console of my browser. I made
							strings  as values for the make, model, and color. I then used a
							number to describe the year and a boolean to describe whether I was
							the official owner. I then declared the age by subtracting 2020 from
							the year previously declared and used consol.log to test it out.
							Next, I needed to transfer all of that information into a JavaScript
							file using document.write.ln instead of console.log to print the
							information out. Finally, I needed to add an html file, link the js,
							and customize it with css.
</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>In the console log, I had no issues declaring the variables. However,
						 when I attempted to print the age using console.log, I forgot to use
						 a camelcase. So instead of writing, console.log(“carAge =”, carAge),
						 I wrote console.log(“carAge =”, carage). As a result, I got an error
						 saying “carage” was not a defined variable. So I rewrote the whole log
						 to get a cleaner screenshot. I had no issue transferring the information
						 over to a JavaScript file. I had a little trouble linking the js file
						 to the html document though. I copied to link a js file the format
						 exactly from the lab assignment. But while Wes’ js file may have been
						 named “lab5.js”, mine was just named “lab.js” located in the “js”
						 folder of the “lab5” folder. So I needed to alter the way I referenced
						 the js file.
</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You are looking at the results of my Lab 5 assignment. It was fairly
						simple considering the fact that I have already learned and began using
						these concepts for more complex assignments. However, I will always
						appreciate a good review.
