	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
	<p>The subject of this lab was to organize our files so they are easily<br>
		 acessessable when drafting our html files. We also needed to draft a website<br>
		 homepage that we could add links to our lab assignments <br>
	</p>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was not difficult creating or organizing the files and folders for each lab<br>
		because they were already correctly configured when we downloaded the repository.<br>
		It was challenging to understand the proper way to link back to files such as images<br>
		so they can be utilized in our html file.
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is the end result. This is an image of my file stucture:</p>
