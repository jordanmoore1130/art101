      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Caleb</h3>
      <p>My name is Caleb and I go by he/him-they/them pronouns.<br>
        I am a 4th-year Cog Sci major with a concentration in AI and <br>
        Human-Computer Interaction. I have knowledge of C++, however, my <br>
        primary focus is python and javascript as programming languages <br>
        and CSS/HTML as markup. Aside from school, I work, run, scuba dive,<br>
        play video games like Death Stranding, Journey, and soon Horizon Zero <br>
        Dawn: Forbidden West.</p>
        <h3>Jordan</h3>
      <p>My name is Jordan and I am a first-year art major here at Santa Cruz.<br>
         I am really enjoying my experience on campus so far and look forward to<br>
         hopefully meeting everyone in person soon! I have very minimal experience <br>
         coding, but I do enjoy digital art. I've used Procreate and MediBang to<br>
         illustrate with my tablet. I was an illustrator and cartoonist for my high<br>
         school's newspaper and am currently sending submissions to publications here at<br>
         UCSC. In my free time, I like to run, write, draw, and walk around in the forest.</p>
